# Old-Work-Stuff
Jupyter Notebooks of stuff I have done as part of my research

The notebook called apollonian is a Random Apollonian Packing simulation I did as part of my masters thesis. The notebook called gasket is a simulation of the Apollonian Gasket. I apologize for the lack of comments, these were a solo project and I do not expect anyone to find much use for these unless you are trying to do the same thing as me.

The MFDFA notebook has an implementation of the MFDFA for a time series of Resistance. In case anyone is trying to do MFDFA for some other purpose you may find it helpful. But again I didn't much comments :)

MD was made to analyze LAMMPS trajectories of an atomistic model of Bubble Rafts. There are other probably better codes available but it seemed pretty straightforward to do myself.

Try4 and Voids were made to detect Bubbles and Voids of Bubble Rafts using Hough Circles in OpenCV in python.

If you need help to understand any of these codes, feel free to contact me at: anpujnairs[at]gmail.com
